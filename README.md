This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set your input and output filenames and the discipline name in `/src/app/route.ts` on lines 139, 204, and 284.

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

In a separate terminal, request the server run the program:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

(Yes, it's janky. But it works!)
